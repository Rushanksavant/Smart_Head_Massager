    <p>In this day to day busy life, problems like headaches, soothe tension, stress, etc are common. According to surveys, 89% of Indians face the problem of headaches due to stress. </p>
    <p>We come up with a head massager which can help user release anxiety and gain peace and relaxation, by providing massage in all parts of head including the forehead. </p>
    <p>The special thing about this massager is that you can just slightly bend your head in the direction of the part you want to get a massage, and the massager will provide massage according to your head's orientation.</p>

    <h2><b>Working of Prototype</b></h2>
    <p>For the Prototype, we used coin vibrational motors to provide massage. These motors were connected to a wearable Hat in all directions to ensure proper massage in all parts of head.</p>
    <p>The high/low output for this motor came from an ECU</p>
    <h3>ADXL</h3>

    <p>The ECU was connected with an ADXL accelerometer, which detected the change in orientation of head, and gave the signal accordingly. This signal was processed by the ECU, after which it gave output for the coin vibrational motors. </p>
    <p>Resulting, massage of head in the direction of slight bend</p><br>
